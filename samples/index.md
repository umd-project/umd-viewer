### Samples
This section will showcase how to integrate the `umd-viewer.min.js` in a custom webapp or website.

##### Sample 1
This will allow the user to upload an UMD file from the local drive and display on the web page.
(umd-with-file.html)(./umd-with-file.html)
{:target="_blank"}

##### Sample 2
This will allow the user to upload an UMD file by entering the URL of the file stored on an internet server (with CORS enabled!).
(umd-with-url.html)(./umd-with-url.html)
{:target="_blank"}
